Life expectancy means the estimation of the numbers of years the individual will survive. It further depends on age, 
sex and location where the person is living.It also helps in the treatment of patients which are underlying with 
certain diseases or illness. For eg. by predicting life expectancy we can analyze the aggresiveness of any disease.
 A large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. 
 After pre processing the dataset we will remove the noise from it. After removing the noise we will clean the dataset.
IBM Watson, machine learning and node red are an integral part of an analysis.The end product will be a web page where
you need to give all the required inputs and then submit it. Afterwards it will predict the life expectancy value 
based on regression  technique.
